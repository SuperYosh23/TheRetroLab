        <h3>📱 Modded DSi</h3>
        <img src="images/dsi.jpg" alt="Modded Nintendo DSi" />
        <p>This DSi is my most prized possession. I can emulate all gameboy models on it, and it can load games from an sd card now using TwilightMenu++. I use this thing almost every day.</p>

        <h3>🎮 Softmodded Wii</h3>
        <img src="images/wii.jpg" alt="Modded Nintendo Wii" />
        <p>This is my second most prized possession. It has all my games, homebrew apps, and it's loaded up with themes.</p>

        <h3>💻 Lenovo G50-45</h3>
        <img src="images/g50-45.jpg" alt="Lenovo G50-45 running Kubuntu" />
        <p>This thing is barely by lenovo anymore. It has a broken power button, broken usb port, and broken sata port. I use it for messing around with random stuff because i don't really care about it.</p>

        <p>This is the desktop of my daily driver. I used to use KDE, but after my install got damaged beyond repair i was forced to switch to GNOME. </p>
