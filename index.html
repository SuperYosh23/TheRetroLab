        <h3>Modded DSi</h3>
        <img src="images/dsi.jpg" alt="Modded Nintendo DSi" />
        <p>I love this thing to death. I can emulate all gameboy models on it, and it can load games from an sd card now using TwilightMenu++. I use this thing almost every day.</p>

        <h3>🎮 Softmodded Wii</h3>
        <img src="images/wii.jpg" alt="Modded Nintendo Wii" />
        <p>This is probably my favorite console that I own. It has all my games, homebrew apps, and it has a dark mode theme.</p>

        <h3>Lenovo G50-45</h3>
        <img src="images/g50-45.jpg" alt="Lenovo G50-45 running Kubuntu" />
        <p>This thing is barely by lenovo anymore. It has a broken power button, broken usb port, and broken sata port. I use it for messing around with random stuff because i don't really care about it.</p>

        <h3>My Main Computer</h3>
        <img src="images/gnome-desktop.png" alt="Customized GNOME desktop" />
        <p>This is the desktop of my daily driver. I used to use KDE, but after my install got damaged beyond repair, i was forced to switch to GNOME. </p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a random idiot who’s into older tech, modding consoles, and making them do things that they shouldn't be able to do. I like taking old junk and making it useful again.</p>
